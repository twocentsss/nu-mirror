# Project Nu: Organized life. Across time. Without friction.

**"Nu organizes your days so your life can compound."**

We’ve all been there. Days blur together. Effort feels disconnected. Energy disappears without explanation. You’re busy, but you aren’t necessarily *directed*. 

Project Nu is a hard stance on human behavior. We believe that if your days are organized, your life compounds. If they aren’t, nothing else matters. Nu is the system that turns your daily effort into visible, meaningful progress.

## The Vision
Nu isn't a task manager. It’s an operating system for your days. It’s designed to decide what you already want but can’t articulate: a way to stop falling behind silently and start building something that lasts.

### One line in. Life gets lighter.
- **Everything in one place**: Career, body, learning, and ambition finally stop competing.
- **Effort that counts**: We show you day-by-day that your work is real.
- **Calm continuity**: Replace mental overload with a system that remembers so you don't have to.

## The Nu Protocol
Nu provides a tailored structure for your specific life horizon. We’ve mapped **36 concrete human wants** across 9 life foci and 4 age stages to ensure your expansion is directed, not random.

- **18: Stop falling behind. Start stacking wins.**
- **24: Experiment boldly. Keep your life intact.**
- **34: Protect your energy. Own your week.**
- **44: Turn years of effort into clear influence.**
