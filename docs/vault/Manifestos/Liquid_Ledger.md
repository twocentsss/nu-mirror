# Liquid Ledger: Graphing Finance as Flow and Form

> "Shape the River, Don't Chase the Clock."

## 1. The Vision
Life is not a list. Life is flow. most drift isn't caused by laziness—it's caused by invisible flow: leaks, friction, unacknowledged downstream costs, and a lack of "riverbed" structure.

**Nu Flow** turns everything into a governed stream of **FlowEvents**.
*   Every meaningful moment becomes a drop with metadata.
*   Drops route through channels (direct action), fill reservoirs (capacity), create deltas (outcomes), or escape as leaks (loss).

## 2. The Core Philosophy: Two-Sided Balance
Every FlowEvent obeys the same invariant as double-entry accounting:
**Draw == Pour**. If something is spent, it went somewhere.

*   **Debit-side (Sink)**: Where value is applied.
*   **Credit-side (Source)**: Where value is sourced from.
*   **Amount**: The quantifiable unit (minutes, USD, kWh, points).

## 3. The Water Metaphor (7 Segments)
These segments map GL concepts to hydrology:

| Segment | Water Name | GL Meaning | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S1** | **Spring** | Sources | 1440m/day, Salary, Energy budget |
| **S2** | **Reservoirs** | Assets/Capacity | Sleep reserve, Skill capital |
| **S3** | **Backpressure** | Liabilities/Debt | Chores backlog, Admin debt |
| **S4** | **North Star** | Equity/Values | Purpose, Identity |
| **S5** | **Deltas** | Returns/Outcomes | Shipped work, Workout done |
| **S6** | **Channels** | COGS/Direct Do | Deep work, Cooking |
| **S7** | **Leaks** | Expenses/Loss | Doomscrolling, Context switching |

**Segment 0: Entity/Context** (The Balancing Dimension)
*   **Entity**: Self, Household, Work, Community.
*   **Context**: Home, Office, Outside, Commute.
*   **Mode**: Deep, Light, Social, Recovery.

## 4. WorldGraph: The Truth Engine
All data lives in a canonical knowledge graph.
*   **Nodes**: Component, World, FlowEvent, Delta, Gate.
*   **Edges**: CREATES_BACKPRESSURE, POURS_INTO, DRAWS_FROM.

## 5. Governance: Council of You
*   **Weekly Council**: Review leaks, backpressure, and channels.
*   **Config-Driven**: All rules are externalized in Sheets.
*   **BYO**: Bring Your Own Key/Storage/Compute.
