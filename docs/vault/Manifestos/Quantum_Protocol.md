# Nu Flow Quantum Protocol

> "Classical makes it true. Quantum makes it usable."

## 1. Classical Truth, Quantum Foresight
We do not quantum-ize truth. We quantum-ize proposals, predictions, and plans.
*   **Classical Ledger**: The river that did flow. Append-only, strict, truth.
*   **Quantum Layer**: The cloud system that might rain. Probabilistic, adaptive.

## 2. New Objects
### 2.1 ProposedFlowEvent (Superposition)
A candidate truth with probability mass across multiple routes.
*   **Superposition**: "Lunch with Sarah" could be `S6 Social` (30%) or `S6 Work` (70%).
*   **Status**: `open`, `collapsed`, `expired`.

### 2.2 CollapseEvent (Measurement)
Daily Close is a **Measurement Ceremony**.
*   Collapses proposals into truth.
*   Turns uncertainty into clean ledger entries.

### 2.3 ScenarioBranch (Many Futures)
Week planning creates Branch A ("Ship Mode"), Branch B ("Recovery"), etc.
*   **Simulated**: Deltas, reservoir levels, backpressure growth.

## 3. Quantum Mechanics for Life
*   **Entanglement**: Coupled reservoirs. `SleepReservoir` ↔ `DoomscrollLeak`.
*   **Interference**: Habits amplify or cancel (Gym + Deep Work = Constructive).
*   **Tunneling**: Micro-actions to bypass resistance ("2-min dish rinse").

## 4. The Quantum Rules Engine
*   **Probabilistic Matching**: Matchers output distributions, not single answers.
*   **Value of Information (VoI)**: Ask fewer, smarter questions. Only prompt if VoI is high.
*   **Adaptive Gates**: Gates have intensity (Soft/Hard/Drain).

## 5. Adoption Path
1.  **Sync**: Calendar/Reminders produce `ProposedFlowEvents`.
2.  **Collapse**: User confirms/corrects in DayNanny.
3.  **Simulation**: "Replay" shows how config v12 would change predictions.
