# LifeLedger: Track Your Life Like Money

> "Because time is the only thing you can't earn back."

## The Pitch
You’re not lazy. You’re leaking time in places you can’t see.
Most productivity apps are just prettier to-do lists. They don't answer the only question that matters: **Where did my life go today?**

**LifeLedger** turns your day into a clean ledger:
1.  **Transactions**: Every moment is a debit/credit.
2.  **Reports**: Time P&L, Scroll Tax, Asset Growth.
3.  **No Guilt**: Scrolling isn't "bad", it's just an account. Want more? Cool. Want less? Move the funds.

## The Core Mechanic: 1440 Reconciliation
Every day ends with one question:
**Does your day reconcile to 1440 minutes?**

If it doesn't, your life is "uncategorized." Once categorized, it becomes steerable.

## Marketing Copy (Viral Ads)
### Ad 1: "1440"
"You have 1440 minutes today. If you can't tell me where they went... someone else decided for you."

### Ad 2: "Scroll Tax"
"Your phone isn't stealing your money. It's stealing your life. Here's your scroll tax. In minutes."

### Ad 3: "You're Not Lazy"
"You're not lazy. You're unaccounted. Once your time is categorized, it becomes controllable."
