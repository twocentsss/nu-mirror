# Nu Flow Protocol

**Track your life like money. Because time is the only thing you can't earn back.**

## The Core Equation
**1440 Minutes. Every Day.**

You're not lazy. You're leaking time.
Most productivity apps are just prettier to-do lists. They don't answer the only question that matters: *Where did my life go today?*

### 1. Daily Reconciliation
Every day ends with one question: **Does your day reconcile to 1440 minutes?**

### 2. LifeLedger (P&L)
See your **Scroll Tax**, **Asset Growth**, and where your minutes actually went.

### 3. No Guilt (∞)
Scrolling isn't "bad", it's just an account. Want less? Move the funds.
*"If you can't tell me where your 1440 minutes went... someone else decided for you."*

## Personalization: Managing "Me"
The Nu Platform offers the engine (The Ledger, The Graph). **You bring the rules.**

### 1. Your Data, Your Rules (BYO)
We don't want your data. We want you to own it. We just orchestrate the magic.
*   **BYO Keys**: Encrypt your private data with your own keys. We never see your raw thoughts.
*   **BYO Storage**: S3, Google Drive, or local. Your life, your cloud.
*   **BYO Config**: Fork the config sheet and run your own rules. Full control.

### 2. The 9 Worlds (Configurable Foci)
The system comes with a default "standard model" of 8 structured domains + 1 chaos.
**But you can customize, rename, or completely replace them.**

| Default World | Focus | Personalization Potential |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Core** | Soul, purpose, being | *Can be "Religion", "Meditation", "Dao"* |
| **2. Self** | Body, mind, heart | *Can be "Athletics", "Biohacking"* |
| **3. Circle** | Family, friends, love | *Can be "Tribe", "Social", "Networking"* |
| **4. Grind** | Work, responsibilities | *Can be "Career", "Empire", "Duty"* |
| **5. Level Up** | Skills, growth, business | *Can be "Study", "R&D", "Creation"* |
| **6. Impact** | Giving back, community | *Can be "Volunteer", "Mentorship"* |
| **7. Play** | Joy, creativity, travel | *Can be "Art", "Gaming", "Adventure"* |
| **8. Insight** | Knowledge, wisdom | *Can be "Reading", "Library", "Science"* |
| **9. Chaos** | The unexpected | *The Universal Constant (Keep this)* |

### 3. Vending & Sharing (The Marketplace)
Personalization isn't just for you. It's for sharing.
*   **Export Config**: Share your "Life Setup" (Tenets, Rules, Morning Routine, Defaults).
*   **Import**: "Install" a productivity guru's system (e.g., "The Monk Mode Config" or "The CEO Config").
*   **Community Vending**: Create custom Foci areas and share them with the world.

## The System Architecture
This is a customizable operating system for your life.

1.  **Defaults**: We provide sensible defaults (The Zen Constitution).
2.  **Overrides**: You provide the "Personalization" layer.
    *   *Settings, Tenets, Rules, Strategies, Goals, Projects, Reports, Artifacts, Metrics, Learnings.*
3.  **Execution**: The engine runs *your* logic on *your* data.
