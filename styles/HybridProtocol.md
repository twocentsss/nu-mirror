# Hybrid Protocol: The Visionary Instrument

The Hybrid Protocol combines the **spatial multi-dock layout** of the Nu Style with the **premium finishing and visionary weight** of the Apple Style. It transforms the application from a task-list into a "Command Orbit for Human Stability."

## 1. Docks: The Command Orbit
- **Structure**: 4-sided (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).
- **Glass**: `bg-zinc-950/90` with `backdrop-blur-3xl`.
- **Borders**: Ultra-thin `border-white/10` with a subtle outer glow/shadow.
- **Handles**:
  - Labels use the "Apple Eyebrow" style: `text-[10px] font-black uppercase tracking-[0.6em] text-white/40`.
  - On hover, the handle glows with a context-specific gradient (e.g., Blue for Protocol, Emerald for Momentum).
  - Magnetic Interaction: Icons and handles scale up slightly on hover.

## 2. Views: The Visionary Tools
- **The Evidence (Report)**: Massive typography, dark-to-black gradients, and "Stance" cards for daily wins.
- **The Momentum (Waterfall)**: Kinetic, clean layout focusing on the "Current Beat."
- **The World (Graph)**: A dark, fluid map of connections.
- **Identity (Protocol)**: The visionary home, using the "Apple Style" landing page logic within a modal.

## 3. Typography
- **Headings**: `font-black tracking-tighter`.
- **Labels**: High-tracking uppercase for semantic weight.
- **Body**: Medium-weight with high leading for legibility.

## 4. Interaction Physics
- **Modals**: Scale and opacity transitions (`initial: { scale: 0.95, opacity: 0 }`).
- **Feedback**: Subtle vibration/pops on "Committing" actions (Done, Capture).
