# Project Nu: Product Strategy & Guide

## Vision
**"Nu is a calm place to put thoughts so your mind can rest."**

Project Nu is a **Quantum Operating System for Human Potential**. Unlike traditional task managers that focus on *doing*, Nu focuses on *being* and *becoming*. It is designed to reduce cognitive load, automate the mundane, and provide a narrative framework for personal growth.

## Core Features

### 1. Zero-Decision Capture
The single most important interaction in Nu. A one-line input field that accepts anything: tasks, thoughts, dates, or rants. 
- **Linguistic Parsing**: Nu uses advanced LLMs to instantly categorize your input.
- **Classification**: Automatically assigns one of the **LF-9** (Life Focus) areas.
- **Capture ≠ Commitment**: Every input is a "note" first. Nu doesn't nag; it holds.

### 2. The LF-9 (Life Focus) Matrix
Nu organizes all human activity into 9 canonical domains to ensure balanced growth:
- **CORE**: Chores, bills, foundational maintenance.
- **SELF**: Mental and physical health, reflection.
- **CIRCLE**: Family, friends, social connections.
- **GRIND**: Professional work, admin, "the day job."
- **LEVEL UP**: Skill acquisition, business growth, learning.
- **IMPACT**: Volunteering, giving back, legacy.
- **PLAY**: Joy, travel, guilt-free entertainment.
- **INSIGHT**: Deep reading, ideas, philosophical exploration.
- **CHAOS**: Triage, rants, fires that need extinguishing.

### 3. Projections (Today & Week)
Instead of a static list, Nu generates **Projections**.
- **Today View**: A dynamically prioritized list of what matters *right now*.
- **Weekly Outcomes**: Strategic "jars" that fit your capacity and goals.
- **Quantum Planning**: Automatically fits tasks into available time gaps.

### 4. Narrative & Gamification
Nu turns your life into a story.
- **Story Arcs**: Tracks your struggles and resolutions over time.
- **Comics**: Generates visual representations (1-panel or 3-panel comics) of your week.
- **Bingo & Quests**: Light-touch rewards for consistency, not just completion.

### 5. Personal Ledger
A dual-entry accounting system for your life's non-monetary currency:
- **Energy**: Don't overbook if your energy is low.
- **Time**: Real-time tracking of capacity.
- **Focus**: Credits earned for deep work sessions.

## Use Cases

### For the Overwhelmed Creator
Capture every "spark" without breaking your flow. Nu holds the thought, classifies it, and brings it back during your "Insight" or "Level Up" sessions.

### For the Balanced Professional
Separate "Grind" from "Self." Nu ensures that even in the busiest work weeks, your "Circle" and "Self" tasks remain visible and prioritized.

### For the Strategic Planner
Use the **SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)** framework to break down complex problems into actionable tasks.

## Usage Workflow

1.  **Auth**: Simple Google SSO.
2.  **Capture**: Type "Call Mom tomorrow at 6pm" into the top bar.
3.  **Trust**: Nu tags this as `CIRCLE`, `EVENT`, and `URGENT`.
4.  **Engage**: Check your **Today** view. The task is there, waiting for the right time.
5.  **Reflect**: At the end of the week, view your **Life Comic** to see how your "Story" progressed.

## The Zen Constitution
- **One line in → life gets lighter.**
- **UI primitives are only 3**: Capture → Today → Gentle feedback.
- **Complexity Belongs in the Engine**: Advanced logic is invisible by default.
- **Trust is a Feature**: Your data is yours. Exportable, inspectable, and reversible.
