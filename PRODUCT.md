# Project Nu: The Stance

**"Nu organizes your days so your life can compound."**

People don’t want philosophy. They want clear, tiny wins that add up to fewer regrets. Across continents and cultures, the desire is the same: **more predictable days, visible progress, and fewer small disasters.**

Nu provides the structure for nine life foci:
1. **Body & Energy**
2. **Focus & Mind**
3. **Career & Work**
4. **Learning & Mastery**
5. **Side Projects & Impact**
6. **Relationships**
7. **Family & Responsibilities**
8. **Friends & Social Life**
9. **Rest, Joy & Hobbies**
